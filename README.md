# Description
I used sockets in python to create this repo.
It is a simple client and server, which accepts one connection to the server then closes the connecion and exits.
# Usage
You will need two command line or terminal instances.
start with the server and run:<br>
<code>echo-server.py</code><br>
start the client as follows:<br>
<code>python echo-client.py 127.0.0.1 65432 </code><br>
# Disclaimer
Use this project on the loopback interface(localhost/127.0.0.1) for security reasons.
